# Coffee-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the "Coffee Quality Data (CQI May-2023)" dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into the various factors that influence coffee quality, such as altitude, country of origin, and other attributes. The analysis was performed using Python and various data visualization libraries.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Coffee Quality Data (CQI May-2023)," which includes several features related to coffee samples, such as:

Country: The country where the coffee was produced.
Altitude: The altitude at which the coffee was grown.
Quality: The overall quality score of the coffee.
Acidity: The acidity level of the coffee.
Aroma: The aroma score of the coffee.
Flavor: The flavor score of the coffee.
Aftertaste: The aftertaste score of the coffee.

## Analysis
The project includes several visualizations created using libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly Express. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence coffee quality. By examining various attributes like altitude, acidity, and flavor, we gain insights into what makes a coffee sample stand out. The analysis serves as a practical application of data exploration techniques and helps in drawing meaningful conclusions from the data.
